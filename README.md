This alarm wrist band features:
- Esp32 micro controller for the brains,
- RGB LED for battery viewing and feedback,
- Battery enough for a few nights of charge and also charges using usb c, 
- Two DC motors providing enough strength for the compression to be noticeable but not enough to be harmful,
-   Depending on the strength might add a mechanical safety stress limiter so that if the band compresses enough it will break, (can make it reusable).
